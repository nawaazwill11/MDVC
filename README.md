# MDVC
A simple tool for simple arithmetic calculation where you can add variables and formulas, remove them, store and load them from a file, on the go. 
The tool is very basic at present. Looking for better ideas and suggestion for improving the script.
You can use it for performing calculations where you have to store values, and use same formulas again. 
MDVC can prove useful when you are are experimenting and creating your own formulas and you need to save it down somewhere. 

Upcoming changes:
1. Chain saved formulas to perform much complex calculations.
2. Create a log file and log in every calculation information, also allowing you to view previous calculations. Like a view history option.
3. No overriding previous saved files. Create and main version of formulas and variables.
